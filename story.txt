There was a princess named Gracia and she lived in the wilderness. 
Everyday she foraged for berries and mushrooms in the woods to feed herself.
She was a vegan by default.

One day she was washing berries that she foraged by the river, and she saw a young man on the other side of the river. 
He was wearing a clean purple shirt and was playing flute by the river.
She immediately fell in love with him.
