There was a princess named Gracia and she lived in the wilderness. 
Everyday she foraged for berries and mushrooms in the woods to feed herself.
She was a vegan by default.

One day she was washing berries that she foraged by the river, and she saw a young man on the other side of the river. 
He was wearing a clean purple shirt and was playing flute by the river.
She immediately fell in love with him.

Gracia was too afriad to speak to the man upon her first time seeing him. 
She went to the same spot everyday for the next month, trying to build up the courage to talk to him.
After several weeks had passed she finally approached him.  He was presently surpised to meet her and immedietly took a liking to her.
They met at the same spot and talked for a couple of days, and then he asked her to come with him, but she was unsure.

He pleaded with her to come with him, he wanted to show her a magical place.
Eventually, she reluctantly agreed and he led her on a winding trail through the forest.
They arrived at a magic stream, surrounded by more magic berries and mushrooms than Gracia had ever seen.
Together they dined on magic berries and mushrooms, and lived happily ever after.

The end :)
